                <h2>What Makes a Happy Family?</h2>
                <p>According to child psychologists, a happy family is not defined by perfection, but by connection, support, and shared joy.</p>
                <blockquote>"The happiest families aren't those without struggles, but those who navigate them with love and understanding." – Dr. Jane Smith</blockquote>
                <p>Shared routines, open communication, and emotional safety are key elements that help families thrive.</p>
